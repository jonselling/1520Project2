				My work experience with Federated Investors has been my first step into the professional work environment and I excelled.
				I designed SQL code to manipulate or find data correctly, and created shell/batch scripts to transfer files around on a server
				while using a scheduler to coordinate when the scripts were going to be run. I completed all of the requests on time and within
				the business parameters. I gained valuable team experience when I worked
				with other people and communicated effectively to find a solution for the project we were all working on.

				I have recently accepted a position as an Embedded Systems Software Intern with Mine Safety Appliances for Summer 2016. 
				I am extremely excited to see what is in store for me and am glad for the opportunity to put my skills acquired in the classroom
				to use for a product that is meant to help and keep people safe. I cannot wait to start!

				I have received the Dean's List Honor three times since I have been attending the University of Pittsburgh. I have also applied for and
				received multiple scholarships from the Polish American Congress. I have twice received the Gorecki scholarship for my great academics and 
				constant support of my polish heritage.

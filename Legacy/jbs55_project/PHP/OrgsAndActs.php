				I play trumpet in the University of Pittsburgh Marching and Concert Bands. Band is probably where my best college experiences have occurred
				and I do not regret ever doing it. It is a huge time commitment when we practice sometimes four times per week and then spend most of Saturday
				at Heinz Field. Band has taught me to manage my time properly so I can keep my grades up, how to put in the most amount of effort when there is
				not much time to rehearse, and also I made some great friends along the way.
				If there was one organization that I would encourage everyone to do if they could it would be a college marching band.

				I am currently an active brother in Mu Kappa Upsilon, a Band Service Fraternity. I have been a brother since December 2014, and enjoy the 
				important service we bring to the band. We help the band in any way the director wants us to (such as helping to organize the band room) but mostly
				we will prepare for practices and get everything set up. We strive to be great musicians and marchers during the marching season. 
				I am proud to be a part of such a good organization and everything that we do.

				I participate in a jazz praise band called The King's Ambassadors. I have been playing with them for about 3 years now, and we volunteer to play
				jazz praise music at churches in the Pittsburgh area. We play on Sunday's about once every two to three months. Every time I play it reminds me why I
				joined the band in the first place. After we are done playing everyone comes up and thanks us and lets us know how wonderful we sounded. This is probably
				one of the best feelings for a musician and I enjoy it every time that we play together. This is a great group for me to keep playing my trumpet
				even after I have graduated and will not be in the bands anymore.
